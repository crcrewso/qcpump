Installing for All Users requires administrator privileges while installing for
only the current user should be possible regardless of user type.  Please note
that either way you install, the pump configuration will be shared across all

and select the QCPump application (usually located at
`C:\\Users\\YOURUSERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\QCPump\\qcpump.exe` if you

if you installed for all users).

Obtaining and running from source
.................................


.. note::

    You will need both Python (version 3.7-3.9) and Git installed on 
    your computer to run QCPump from source.


In order to obtain the source code for QCPump install Git and then clone the
QCPump repository:


.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/qatrackplus/qcpump.git


If you are on Windows, visit https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ and
download DukPy for your particular version of Python.  Now create a new venv to

.. code:: bash

    cd qcpump

    # create your venv
    python -m venv env

    # activate venv on Windows and install requirements
    env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    pip install C:\path\to\dukpy-0.2.3-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl
    pip install -r requirements\base.txt

    # activate venv on *nix
    source env/bin/activate
    # replace 18.04 with your Ubuntu version 
    pip install -U -f https://extras.wxpython.org/wxPython4/extras/linux/gtk3/ubuntu-18.04 wxPython
    pip install -r requirements/base.txt
